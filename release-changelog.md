# v1.17.26
* Update to angular 13 and wildfly 26 [#634](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/634)
* Properties sometimes missing in test generation/deployment [#550](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/550)
  * This adds a unique constraint to avoid the problem and violations have to cleanup up manually before the update can be applied. Find violations:
    ```
    select res1.resource_id, res.name, res1.context_id, res1.id from TAMW_RESOURCECONTEXT res1
    inner join
    (select context_id, resource_id from TAMW_RESOURCECONTEXT group by (context_id, resource_id) having count(*) > 1) res2
    on res1.context_id = res2.context_id and res1.resource_id = res2.resource_id
    join TAMW_RESOURCE res on res1.resource_id = res.id;
    ```
  * To clean them up you have to delete the affected resources and recreate them manually via UI.
  * Sometimes I was able to fix it by creating a new release of the resource, deleting the old release and changing the release of the new release. You have to check that all properties were copied to the new release before deleting because they can be missing.

# v1.13.0

This release contains a new and enhanced permission system and bugfixes.

## New features
* New permission system [#25](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/25): the permission system has been rewriten to allow for permissions to be scoped by environement, resource and resource type. See [documentation](https://github.com/liimaorg/docs/blob/master/content/permissions.md) for more details. Important:
  * Migration to the new permission system happens automatically via Liquibase. Please check if the permissions of the roles are still correct after the migration.
  * The role app_developer can now also rename applications. This is because rename is part of the update action.
  * The role app_developer can no longer edit encrypted properties by default.
* Resource relation names are now editable [#78](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/78)
* New REST function to add relations to resources [#51](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/51)
* New REST function `GET /resources/{resourceGroupName}/lte/{releaseName}` that fetches the lower or equal release to the given one [#86](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/86)

## Bug fixes
* The REST service did not encrypt property values before writing it to the DB [#131](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/131)
* The Angular page `Create new deployment` showed the wrong apps and app versions for some releases [#113](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/113) and [#127](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/127)
* The log dropdown of the deployment log page is sorted again [#128](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/128)

## API Changes
* In ch.mobi.itc.mobiliar.rest.dtos.ResourceRelationDTO the new property *relationName* will replace the property *identifier*. The property *identifier* will be removed by v1.14. The following REST URIs are concerned:
  * /resources
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}/{releaseName}
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}/lte/{releaseName}
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}/{releaseName}/relations
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}
  * /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/mostRelevant/
  * /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/
  * /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/{releaseId}
* appsWith**Mvn**Version in the ch.mobi.itc.mobiliar.rest.dtos.DeploymentDTO is depricated and will be removed in v1.14. It was replaced with appsWithVersion in v1.12. This change concerns all /deployment REST URIs. New and old deployment JSON:
  ```
  {
    "id": 281100,
    "trackingId": 259609,
    "state": "progress",
    "deploymentDate": 1501145413850,
    "appServerName": "liima",
    # new
    "appsWithVersion": [
      {
        "applicationName": "org.liima.test",
        "version": "4.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
      }
    ],
    # old, depricated
    "appsWithMvnVersion": [
      {
        "applicationName": "org.liima.test",
        "mavenVersion": "4.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
      }
    ],
  }
  ```
