* Update Java Script dependencies [#688](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/688)

# v1.17.28
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Due to a new unique constraint for issue [#622](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/622), `TAMW_RESOURCE` needs to be free of duplicate `RELEASE_ID, RESOURCEGROUP_ID` pairs **before** applying the change-set. Duplicates can be found using following sql statement:
  ```
  select count(*), RELEASE_ID, RESOURCEGROUP_ID from TAMW_RESOURCE group by RELEASE_ID, RESOURCEGROUP_ID having count(*) > 1;
  select * from TAMW_RESOURCEGROUP where id = <found id>
  ```
  You can delete the duplicate release via UI. The UI will only show one release and when you delete it the hidden release will surface. Copy the currently visible release to a backup resource and the delete the visible release.
* Fixed security issues:
  * Fix HQL Injection via application name: [#679](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/679)
  * Fix possible XSS vulnerabilities in Tooltips and Notifications: [#680](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/680)

  * Fix HQL injection via deployment filter: [#663](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/663)
* Update to Angular 14 and Bootstrap 5: [#661](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/661)
* Deployment filter Reason has no values: [#594](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/594)
* resourceDependenciesView.xhtml sort: [#607](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/607)
* Add audit tables for permissions entities: [#653](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/653)
* Replace net.sf.json-lib with another JSON library: [#566](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/566)
* Various JS and Java lib updates

# v1.17.27
* **BREAKING CHANGE** New release of relation uses old prop descriptor for copied instance property [#487](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/487)
  * This fixes a long-standing bug in Liima and requires manual database cleanup before the updated can be deployed. Instructions can be found [here](./AMW_db_scripts/v1.17.27_property_cleanup.md)
* REST DELETE: /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/{releaseId} deletes non matching releases [#623](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/623)
* Update Angular and other JavaScript dependencies:
  * update angular [#656](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/656)
  * Bump async from 2.6.3 to 2.6.4 in /AMW_angular/io [#654](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/654)
  * Bump minimist from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6 in /AMW_angular/io [#649](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/649)
  * Bump karma from 6.3.14 to 6.3.16 in /AMW_angular/io [#648](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/648)
* Update java dependencies:
  * Bump jackson-databind from 2.11.2 to 2.12.6.1 [#655](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/655)
  * Bump junit from 4.11 to 4.13.1 in /AMW_shakedown/AMW_stp_archetype/src/main/resources/archetype-resources [#645](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/645)
  * Bump postgresql from 9.4-1200-jdbc41 to 42.2.25 in /AMW_db_scripts [643](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/643)
  * Update liquibase [658](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/658)

# v1.17.26
* Update to angular 13 and wildfly 26 [#634](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/pull/634)
* Properties sometimes missing in test generation/deployment [#550](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/550)
  * This adds a unique constraint to avoid the problem and violations have to cleanup up manually before the update can be applied. Find violations:
    ```
    select res1.resource_id, res.name, res1.context_id, res1.id from TAMW_RESOURCECONTEXT res1
    inner join
    (select context_id, resource_id from TAMW_RESOURCECONTEXT group by (context_id, resource_id) having count(*) > 1) res2
    on res1.context_id = res2.context_id and res1.resource_id = res2.resource_id
    join TAMW_RESOURCE res on res1.resource_id = res.id;
    ```
  * To clean them up you have to delete the affected resources and recreate them manually via UI.
  * Sometimes I was able to fix it by creating a new release of the resource, deleting the old release and changing the release of the new release. You have to check that all properties were copied to the new release before deleting because they can be missing.
* getResourceRelationListForRelease should always return same release of relation [#626](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/626)
* Implement REST GET /resources/{resourceId} [#627](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/627)

# v1.17.25

  * Fix REST exception mapping

  * Don't log freemarker template exceptions in application server log

# v1.13.0

This release contains a new and enhanced permission system and bugfixes.

## New features
* New permission system [#25](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/25): the permission system has been rewriten to allow for permissions to be scoped by environement, resource and resource type. See [documentation](https://github.com/liimaorg/docs/blob/master/content/permissions.md) for more details. Important:
  * Migration to the new permission system happens automatically via Liquibase. Please check if the permissions of the roles are still correct after the migration.
  * The role app_developer can now also rename applications. This is because rename is part of the update action.
  * The role app_developer can no longer edit encrypted properties by default.
* Resource relation names are now editable [#78](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/78)
* New REST function to add relations to resources [#51](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/51)
* New REST function `GET /resources/{resourceGroupName}/lte/{releaseName}` that fetches the lower or equal release to the given one [#86](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/86)

## Bug fixes
* The REST service did not encrypt property values before writing it to the DB [#131](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/131)
* The Angular page `Create new deployment` showed the wrong apps and app versions for some releases [#113](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/113) and [#127](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/127)
* The log dropdown of the deployment log page is sorted again [#128](https://github.com/liimaorg/liima/issues/128)

## API Changes
* In ch.mobi.itc.mobiliar.rest.dtos.ResourceRelationDTO the new property *relationName* will replace the property *identifier*. The property *identifier* will be removed by v1.14. The following REST URIs are concerned:
  * /resources
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}/{releaseName}
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}/lte/{releaseName}
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}/{releaseName}/relations
  * /resources/{resourceGroupName}
  * /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/mostRelevant/
  * /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/
  * /resources/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupId}/releases/{releaseId}
* appsWith**Mvn**Version in the ch.mobi.itc.mobiliar.rest.dtos.DeploymentDTO is depricated and will be removed in v1.14. It was replaced with appsWithVersion in v1.12. This change concerns all /deployment REST URIs. New and old deployment JSON:
