# Liima

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The backend must be up and running. The simplest way is to run it in a docker container - in order to build the image, you must have docker, docker-compose, maven and java 11 installed - build the image with:

```bash
npm run backend:build
```

Note: this will take some time!

Start/ stop the backend container with:

```bash
npm run backend:start
npm run backend:stop
```
